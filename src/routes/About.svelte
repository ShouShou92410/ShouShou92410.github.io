			üëãHello, my name is Sean. I was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and moved to Calgary at the age of 12.
			My programming journey began with me trying to modify the CSS styles of a now closed Taiwanese
			blog site, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wretch_(website)">ÁÑ°ÂêçÂ∞èÁ´ô</a>, and I've
			been in love with creating things using code ever since.
			<br />
			<br />
			I started learning Java during my time in high school, and got even more exposure to the programming
			world when I studied in the University of Calgary for my bachelor of science in computer science
			degree. My favorite subjects in university were computer graphics and computer animation because
			I love learning and using advance technologies and mathematical concepts to bring amazing visual
			to life.
			<br />
			<br />
			Currently, I work as an Associate Software Developer in
			<a href="https://www.detechtion.com">Detechtion Technologies</a>. I started off as an intern
			while still finishing my degree, and is where I learn more about web development and cloud
			services. Now as a full time developer, I focus on improving the user experience of our web
			applications, as well as adding new features to make our customers more effective with their
			data.
